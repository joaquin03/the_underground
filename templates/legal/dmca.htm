  <h1>DMCA Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 05/15/2025</p>
  <p><strong>Termination of User Account</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>We will terminate a user’s access to the service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is
      determined to be a repeat infringer.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to decide whether material or activity violates our <a href="/?mod=legal&file=terms">Terms of Use.</a> for
      reasons other than copyright infringement, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM),
      obscenity, or excessive length. We may remove that material or terminate a user’s account for
      submitting that material in violation of our <a href="/?mod=legal&file=terms">Terms of Use.</a></li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Removal of Material for Which Copyright Infringement Is Claimed</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong></p>
  <p>We will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium
    Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to notify an online service
    provider concerning alleged copyright infringement. When an effective DMCA notification is received,
    the online service provider responds by taking down the offending content.</p>
  <p>To File a DMCA Notification:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act for the owner of an exclusive
      right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
    <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple
      copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
      of those works at that site.</li>
    <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
      activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information
      reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. Providing URLs in the
      body of your DMCA notification is the best way to help us locate content quickly.</li>
    <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you (the complaining party), including
      an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you (the
      complaining party) can be contacted.</li>
    <li>A statement that you (the complaining party) have a good faith belief that use of the material in
      the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
    <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
      that you (the complaining party) are authorized to act for the owner of an exclusive right that is
      allegedly infringed.</li>
    <li>Provide information, if possible, sufficient to permit us to notify the user or users who posted
      the content that allegedly contains infringing material.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can send the DMCA Notice to our Designated Agent at:</p>

  <p>Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or an activity is infringing or that
    any material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable to us
    for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us in removing or disabling access to
    the material or activity claimed to be infringing or in replacing the removed material or enabling
    access to it.</p>
