However, please know we do not currently sell data triggering that statute&rsquo;s opt-out requirements.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Your EEA/UK Privacy Rights</strong></p>
  <p><span>If you live in the EEA or the UK, the following terms apply to you.</span></p>
  <p><strong><em>Legal Basis for Processing</em></strong></p>
  <p><span>We may process your personal data because you have given us permission to do so (for example, by sending data through our Website&rsquo;s contact or signup forms), because the processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights, or because we need to process your personal data to perform a contract with you or comply with the law.</span></p>
  <p><strong><em>Your Legal Rights</em></strong></p>
  <p><span>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws concerning your personal data. Your rights may include the following:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Request access</strong><span> to your personal data (commonly known as a &ldquo;data subject access request&rdquo;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Request correction</strong><span> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Request erasure</strong><span> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we might not always be able to comply with your erasure request for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Object to processing</strong><span> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong><span> your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (1) if you want us to establish the data&rsquo;s accuracy; (2) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (3)&nbsp;where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (4) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Request the transfer</strong><span> of your personal data to you or a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong><span> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we might not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@theundergroundsexclub.com"><span>privacy@theundergroundsexclub.com</span></a><span>.</span></p>
  <p><span>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to honor your request in these circumstances.</span></p>
  <p><span>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information regarding your request to speed up our response.</span></p>
  <p><span>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will let you know and keep you updated.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
  <p><span>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We store all information you provide to us on our secure servers behind firewalls.</span></p>
  <p><span>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.</span></p>
  <p><span>Unfortunately, the transmission of information through the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
  <p><span>Except as otherwise permitted or required by law or regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Under some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Withdrawing Your Consent</strong></p>
  <p><span>Where you have provided your consent to the collection, use, and transfer of your personal information, you may have the legal right to withdraw your consent under certain circumstances. To withdraw your consent, if applicable, contact us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@theundergroundsexclub.com"><span>privacy@theundergroundsexclub.com</span></a><span>. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, we might not be able to provide you with a particular product or service. We will explain the impact to you at the time to help you with your decision.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p><span>Our policy is to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users&rsquo; personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account and through a notice on the Website home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date, active, and deliverable email address for you and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes.</span></p>
