  <h1>18 U.S.C. § 2257 Record-Keeping Compliance Statement</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 05/10/2024</p>
  <p>Any actual human being that appears in any visual depiction of actual or simulated sexually explicit
    conduct appearing or otherwise contained on <a href="https://www.theundergroundsexclub.com/">https://www.theundergroundsexclub.com/</a> (the
    “Website”) was at least 18 years old at the time those visual depictions were produced.</p>
  <h3>Exemption: Content Produced by Third Parties</h3>
  <p>The Website’s operator is not the “producer” of any depictions of actual or simulated sexually explicit
    conduct that may appear on the Website. The Website’s operator limits its handling of this content and
    only performs the activities of transmission, storage, retrieval, hosting, or formatting of material that
    might depict sexually explicit conduct, all of which material appears on the Website as the result of
    actions taken by third-party users of the Website. All parts of the Website that contain user-generated
    material are under the control of the relevant user, for whom the Website is provided as an online
    service by the operator. Under 18 U.S.C. § 2257(h)(2)(B)(v) and 47 U.S.C. § 230(c), the Website’s
    operator may delete materials appearing on the Website as the result of actions taken by the Website’s
    users, which materials are considered, in the operator’s sole discretion, to be indecent, obscene,
    defamatory, or inconsistent with the policies and terms of use for the Website.</p>
  <h3>Exemption: Content Produced by Website Operator</h3>
  <p>To the extent that any images or videos appear on the Website, for which the Website’s operator might
    be considered the “producer,” those images and videos are exempt from the requirements of 18 U.S.C.
    § 2257 and 28 C.F.R. Part 75 for one or more of the following reasons: (1) the produced images or videos
    do not portray any sexually explicit conduct defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A); (2) the produced images
    or videos do not portray depictions of the genitals or pubic area created after July 27, 2006; (3) the
    produced images or videos do not portray simulated sexually explicit activity occurring after the
    effective date of 18 U.S.C. § 2257A; or (4) the produced images or videos were created before July 3,
    1995.</p>
  <h3>Designated Records Custodian</h3>
  <p>Without limiting in any way the applicability of the above-stated exemptions, the Website’s operator
    has designated the custodian, whose address appears below, to be the keeper of original records
    described in 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 C.F.R. Part 75 for all materials appearing on the Website that fall in
    the following categories: (1) marketing and advertising materials that contain visual depictions of actual
    or simulated sexually explicit conduct, which materials have been acquired or created by the Website’s
    operator to promote the Website; or (2) materials that are not exempt, as described above.</p>

  <p>The named earlier records and their custodian can be found at the following location:</p>
