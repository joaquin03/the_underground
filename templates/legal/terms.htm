  <p><span>You shall indemnify the Company, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these terms of use or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Website&rsquo;s content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these terms of use, or your use of any information obtained from the Website.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
  <p><span>Nevada law governs all adversarial proceedings arising out of this agreement or the Website.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Equitable Remedies</strong></p>
  <p><span>Each party acknowledges that (1)&nbsp;breach by either party of that party&rsquo;s obligations under this agreement has the potential to cause irreparable harm for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and (2)&nbsp;if any such breach occurs or is threatened and might cause irreparable harm, each party would want a court to grant the other party an injunction, a restraining order, or any other equitable remedy, in each case without posting a bond or other security and without proof of actual damages.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><strong>Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration</strong></p>
  <p style="color:red"><strong>You and the Company are agreeing to give up any rights to litigate claims in a court or before a jury, or to participate in a class action or representative action regarding a claim. Other rights that you would have if you went to court might also be unavailable or might be limited in arbitration.</strong></p>
  <p style="color:red"><strong>As the exclusive means of bringing adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising out of this agreement or the Website (other than any proceeding brought by a party seeking an injunction, a restraining order, or any other equitable remedy to which that party is entitled under the Equitable Remedies provision), a party may demand that the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in accordance with its consumer arbitration rules (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this arbitration provision.</strong><span> The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute regarding the arbitrability or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the agreement is void, voidable, or otherwise invalid. Judgment on any award rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>Any arbitration begun in accordance with this arbitration provision must be conducted by one arbitrator.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>Any arbitration begun in accordance with this arbitration provision must be conducted virtually using Zoom or a virtual meeting platform that provides similar functionality. If virtual arbitration is not feasible due to technical issues, unavailability of virtual services from the arbitration, or other compelling reasons, the arbitration must be conducted in person in Las Vegas, Nevada.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>The arbitrator must not award punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. Each party hereby waives any right to recover any such damages in any arbitration.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys&rsquo; fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>You may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide us with written notice of your intent to do so within 60 days of the date your claim arose. The arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>You agree to arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, </span><strong>neither you nor the Company will be entitled to join or consolidate claims by or against other users in court or in arbitration or otherwise participate in any claim as a class representative, class member, or in a private attorney general capacity. </strong><span>The arbitral tribunal must not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims and must not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver must only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p style="color:red"><span>If any provision of this arbitration provision is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong></p>
  <p><span>If either party brings a proceeding seeking an injunction, a restraining order, or other equitable remedy to which that party is entitled under the Equitable Remedies provision, that party may bring that proceeding only in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada or, only if there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction, in a state court of Nevada sitting in Las Vegas.</span></p>
  <p><span>Each party hereby waives any claim that any proceeding brought in accordance with this provision has been brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of that proceeding is improper.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Recovering Expenses</strong></p>
  <p><span>In an adversarial proceeding between the parties arising out of this agreement or access or use of the Website, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Time Limit to File Claims</strong></p>
  <p><span>Apart from proceedings arising from a claim for indemnification, neither party may initiate adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising out of this agreement or access or use of the Website more than one year after the date that dispute arose.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Waiver and Severability</strong></p>
  <p><span>No waiver of any provision of this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver. No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this agreement will operate as a waiver of that right or remedy. A waiver granted on one occasion will not operate as a waiver on future occasions.</span></p>
  <p><span>If any provision of these terms of use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent so that the remaining provisions of the terms of use will continue in full effect.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
  <p><span>These terms of use constitute the entire understanding between the parties regarding the Website. You acknowledge that because you have not relied on, and will not be relying on, any statements made by the Company regarding the Website, you will have no basis for bringing any claim for fraud in connection with any such statements.</span></p>
